RESTAURANT_DESCRIPTIONS = ["When to go:When your funds are running low but you still want to eat exciting food –
go with a group to taste as much as possible.

What to have:The superbly tender, Burmese-spiced short-rib curry is a true
crowd-pleaser; or snap up any of the nightly specials.

Self-taught chef Ben Chapman played a whopper of a hand with his first solo
gaffe, Smoking Goat; this second venture is a continuation of the Thai
barbecue theme. Kiln is a little less dive-y than its sibling. Instead, its
simple, stripped-back looks work perfectly with the Soho setting and the
style of cooking. Quality, Brit-sourced meat and fish are chargrilled over
embers, Thai-style, and served with the fiery, flavour-packed sauces
typical of rural Thailand – sit up at the counter to watch the chefs and
furnaces in action. ",
"When to go:It’s most fun at dinner, but you do need to go early to get a seat. Even
better, go at 5pm, when you can actually book.

What to have:Anything from the tandoor (such as the naan bread) or the grill (such as
the charred octopus, which is the best in London).

It’s not possible to have a bad time at The Barbary. Sure, you’ll probably
have to queue, but even that’s tolerable, because then you get to feast on
moreish deep-fried snacks (like the Moroccan cigars) that don’t appear on
the main menu. If the queue is huge and spills out of the door, then you
get to hang out in Neal’s Yard, one of London’s loveliest hidden
courtyards. The food is labelled as ‘modern Israeli’, though in truth, it’s
anything but. What they’ve done is taken the ancient recipes from across
North Africa (from the one-time Barbary Coast) and the Middle East that
have gone on to influence food in today’s Israeli kitchen, then reimagined
them. The smoky room is stuffed full of music, laughter and people that are
beautiful in the best way: inside and out.",
"When to go:When you want to say to your mouth, ‘you SHALL go to the ball!’

What to have:The bone marrow varuval (a sort of dry, bone marrow curry for spreading
over a buttery roti), plain hoppers and any of the curries (tip: order an
extra curry instead of several chutneys).

There’s nothing like Hoppers in London. Sure, there’s good Sri Lankan food
in certain pockets of the capital. But very few restaurants are exclusively
Sri Lankan (most are South Indian and certainly don’t do hoppers, the
egg-topped pancakes after which this Soho restaurant is named); the few
exceptions are okay, rather than amazing. So the fact that Hoppers is
outrageously good is even more impressive. The small room, a sexy Soho take
on all things Sri Lankan, is always full and always buzzing (and yes,
you’ll almost certainly have to queue), but it’s more than worth the wait.
If small plates, full flavours and unapologetic spicing are your bag,
Hoppers will get your pulse – and your tastebuds – racing.",
"When to go: When only some genius modern small plates will do

What to have: Everything wows, but try the parsnip and flatbread combo with burnt yeast
cream, pickled garlic and apple

A restaurant in a ‘magic box’ (well, a shipping container, actually), Smoke
& Salt has inherited what was once Kricket’s pop-up space – and look what
happened to that Indian firecracker. This is a place with personality, but
it’s not all show – these guys can really cook, and their dishes are a
triumph of careful composition and texture. How about crunchy-edged new
potato halves over a yin-yang duo of sauces (Gorgonzola and chimichurri)
topped with silky slices of beef heart; or buttery nuggets of octopus and
salsify in a large clam shell with blood orange accents on the side. It’s
all ludicrously good value, and then there’s the service – affable,
clued-up and perfectly paced to make you feel at one with the world.",
"When to go: when you’re bored of all other food.

What to have: the menu changes daily, but plates which embrace carbs are especially
strong: look out for the likes of home-made goujeres, herby pizzette or
plates of pasta. Not forgetting that white bread sarnie, with katsu chicken
inside.

Eating at Bright is a little like eating in a high-ceilinged, metal-framed
glass box, but that’s a good thing: there’s less to distract you from the
food. Which is a brilliant bizarre mix of eclectic, modernist small plates.
The compact menu changes daily, but is generally an eclectic mix of
modernish small plates: look out for the signature chicken katsu sarnie (a
crusts-cut-off white bread number, in dainty quarters), slices of artisanal
charcuterie, dinky plates of off-the-clock pasta, plus inventive plates of
fish, meat or veg (grilled radicchio with preserved cherries, say; or
mussels with curry leaves in a smoked mackerel broth). Best of all: you can
book.",
"When to go:When you’ve had a morning workout and you can totally justify two or three
plates of pasta to yourself.

What to have:Pasta, pasta and more pasta. Big shapes, little shapes, fat and thin. Don’t
bother with starters or puds (nice, but not why you’re here) and definitely
don’t miss the pappardelle with eight-hour beef shin ragu.

Pasta is a funny old thing. On the face of it, so simple. Boring, even. But
this chic little Borough Market pasta bar – from the people behind
Islington’s trendyTrullo– will change the way you feel about it forever. There’s a daily-changing
menu of plates, small enough to allow you to try a few (around two each, if
you pass on starters and puds), but large enough to leave you feeling
genuinely satisfied. It’s all made and cooked to order right in front of
you – everyone gets to perch up at the L-shaped counter, for maximum
viewing pleasure – while the setting, all glass, marble and steel, is
effortlessly chic.",
"When to go:When you want slick service and a big-ticket menu without the formality.

What to have:Shareable jars and killer cocktails kick things off in style.

Ramsay protégé and unstoppable wunderkind Jason Atherton seems hell-bent on
building an international restaurant empire every bit as revered as that of
his mentor. This was one of three London openings he oversaw in 2013 and
his first Soho venture – but he’s barely stopped to draw breath since then.
Social Eating House’s dark, low-slung dining room, with its mirrored
ceiling and modern artworks, feels cool and informal, while chef Paul
Hood’s menu delivers dishes that are at once highly sophisticated,
accessible and above all delicious – often throwing in a welcome touch of
theatricality when you least expect it. Efficient, attentive staff keep
this star-studded show on the road.",
"When to go:When you fancy Indian food without Indian-restaurant clichés – any here
come courtesy of nostalgia for the British chop house.

What to have:The malted kulfi dessert – intensely flavoured malted ice cream topped with
caramelised banana and salted peanuts. Pass the smelling salts…

This cleverly manufactured concept borrows heavily from Dishoom: think
small plates of sexed-up Indian dishes eaten in a buzzing, friendly,
café-style setting (but, for now at least, minus the mile-long queues). We
hoovered up almost everything we tried here, and so will you – from the
herb-strewn seekh kebab and fantastic beef dripping keema naan, to the
finger-licking, blistered, spiced lamb chops, it’s all excellent. Staff
couldn’t be nicer, too, tending to their customers like family members. ",
"When to go: When you’re in need of some tapas fun.

What to have: Everything wows, but the just-runny salt-cod tortilla is sheer eggy bliss.

After years as executive chef at Barrafina, Spanish queen bee Nieves
Barragán Mohacho has opened her first solo gaff – a highly distinctive
set-up spread over two floors (this small-plate tapas counter downstairs,
bookable tables for communal wood-fired feasting upstairs). Some of
Barrafina’s favourite ingredients are still here, but the style is more
rustic, from an incredible salad of black tomato, chorizo and confit
artichoke to a two- part dish involving stuffed chipirón (baby squid) in a
puddle of black ink alongside a piece of breaded hake with aïoli. Also pray
that they’re serving their drool-inducing tartaleta filled with fragrant
poached rhubarb and booze-laced mascarpone. The food’s all-round flawless
and eating here is such fun.",
"When to go: When you need some proper ‘drinking food’ with a proper kick.

What to have: Red-hot smokin’ Thai barbecue, a bowl of lardo fried rice and as much
booze as you can manage.

Having moved from its original Soho dive to new premises in Shoreditch,
this rockin’ Thai barbecue joint now looks and feel like a real restaurant
– albeit one with loads of smoke, noise and music. It’s all about ‘drinking
food’ here, chilli-spiked in-your-face flavours that simply cry out for a
few beers: we suggest the signature fish-sauce chicken wings, the crunchy
deep-fried shell-on prawns (eat ‘em whole) and anything involving unctuous
bulked-out noodles. You know your friend who doesn’t really like spice?
Yeah, don’t bring them.",
"When to go:When you’re in the mood for fiery food you can eat with your fingers – and
have time to queue.

What to have:The fried chicken or confit pork bao, though the small plates (pigs’ blood
cake, trotter nuggets) are brilliant too.

Forget Narnia. This is a wardrobe you really want to enter, but then stay
in. Okay, Bao isn’t actually a wardrobe, but the interior of the dinky Soho
eatery feels so much like being inside a giant wood-veneered Ikea creation,
you can almost hear the couples debating whether they really need 350 tea
lights. But looks aside, Bao is a truly exceptional place. It serves
award-winning Taiwanese street food with plenty of kick (it started life as
a tiny Netil Market stall). It’s the kind of stuff that’s great if you’re a
little bit drunk. Just not paralytic – it’s too good to be wasted on the
wasted.",
"When to go: When you want to prove you’re in touch with the avant-garde.

What to have: Umami mainliners such as chervil roots layered with miso, apples and
‘turbo whey’ – plus any of the bizarrely alluring cocktails.

If you’ve loved Ryan ‘Mr Lyan’ Chetiyawardana’s bars (White Lyan,
Dandelyan, Super Lyan), you’ll love this friendly hangout with its party
soundtrack and funky, recycled, retro decor. Chef and co-founder Doug
McMaster (of Brighton’s Silo) is a no-waste supremo who creates food that’s
as sustainable as it is stunning. The price of the set menu may have gone
up since its launch, but if you’re after an experience something just that
little bit different (the price includes ‘matched cocktails’), then Cub is
the place for you.",
"When to go:As early as poss if you don’t want to stand in line for hours – although
it’s totally worth the wait (itself made more bearable if you order
in-queue drinks and snacks).

What to have:How to choose... It’s all so good. Mix classics such as the impeccably
runny-centred tortilla with more adventurous regional dishes and
going-going-gone specials such as carabineros (flippin’ gigantic, bright
red prawns).

The first Barrafina, on Frith Street (RIP), was the original small-plates-and-no-reservations
counter bar pioneer, a template that has since gone viral. This bustling,
Barcelona-style tapas joint now has branches across town, but Adelaide
Street is the slightly glitzier, slightly larger venue that pays homage to
the original without being a straight copycat. So there’s the same striped
marble bar overlooking the kitchen, but its curved design cleverly allows
for a couple more grateful bums on those burgundy leather stools. There’s a
menu that includes the tapas holy trinity of tortilla, croquetas and jamón,
plus Barrafina’s signature market-fresh seafood, but which also runs to
Josper-grilled meats, offal delicacies such as deep-fried lamb’s brain, and
Mallorcan specialities. In short, it rocks.",
"When to go: When you want to rekindle your love affair with fusion food.

What to have: Everything – from the heirloom tomato salad to the goat’s cream cheesecake
with strawberries.

Born in Malaysia and raised in Sydney, with Chinese/Indian blood on his
mum’s side and Irish/Balinese on his dad’s: no wonder this debut from
eponymous chef Ramael Scully delivers an eclectic hotchpotch of flavours.
How about a rebooted heirloom tomato salad involving green strawberries,
grated coconut and a poured-at-the-table ‘shrub’ (cider vinegar, soy and
sweet tommie juices), or a downright velvety dish of marinated goat –
slow-poached sous-vide for a whopping 36 hours, then presented atop a
splodge of green-chilli-flecked yoghurt, slivers of pickled red onion and
urd lentils. This is sharply focused, bold and surprising stuff served in a
dining room with personality.",
"When to go:Whenever you like: you can actually BOOK. The best ‘counter’ is the main
one, but on a sunny day, the alfresco tables ­– a stone’s throw from
Clapham Common – are a nice people-watching option.

What to have:The mind-bogglingly good ‘nduja with cultured cream and sour potato
flatbread: the best £4 you’ll ever spend.

If you’re the kind of person who likes your napkins starched and a flunkie
to turn it back into a ‘bishop’s hat’ while you nip to the loo, then
Counter Culture is probably not for you. This tiny spin-off of Clapham’s
acclaimedDairyisn’t known as it’s ‘naughty little brother’ for nothing. The music is
grungy, the staff a charming mix of achingly hip and infectiously
enthusiastic, but it’s the cooking (contemporary European, but with
ingredients borrowed from every corner of the globe) that really breaks the
rules. Plates are small but deeply intricate, yet somehow without ever
crossing the line into frou-frou or fussy. It’s casual, creative and cool.",
"When to go:When you think you’ve tried and tasted every dining concept that London has
to offer. Been there, barbecued that? Think again.

What to have:As much as your body can handle – it’s all sooo good. But don’t miss the
tacos with soy-cured beef, if those smoky, sweet and fiery gems are on the
menu.

Scottish chef and barbecue fan Neil Rankin (ex-Smokehouse, ex-Bad Egg) has
created something mega-thrilling at this huge fusion smokehouse in a Soho
basement. Imagine deliciously charred meat carved from whole prime
carcasses, served over home-made rotis or tacos, plus plenty of your
favourite Asian or Latin spices. All set to backdrop of party tunes (MJ,
Beyoncé etc.), with seats in diner-style booths or up at the counter, where
you can watch the action. You don’t have to imagine it: it’s real.",
"When to go: When you and some mates fancy taking the road to Mandalay without leaving
the East End.

What to have: The coconut noodles with chicken and the fragrant fish cake salad (with
caramelised onion, crisp cabbage and crunchy split peas).

Originally holed up in a pokey space on Maltby Street Market, Lahpet has
relocated to an airy site on Shoreditch’s eastern fringes and has turned
itself into an achingly stylish Burmese star – all handsome wood, muted
grey paintwork and chic patterned upholstery. Burmese cuisine is a
cross-breed of Thai and Indian, but the flavours are still very much their
own – if you don’t believe us, try one of their zingy signature salads or
the chunky, succulent hake fillet on a moreish rösti with a fiery masala
sauce. The vibe is buzzy, service is clued-up, portions are enormous and
it’s terrific value – so grab five friends, request one of the booths, and
order as much as you possibly can.",
"When to go:When your carnal urges will only be satisfied by something big and bloody.

What to have:A small steak – because the large ones would feed a family of cheetahs, and
you need to save room for sensational sides and old-school desserts.

The originalHawksmoorin Spitalfields is a great bar and grill – but this newer branch is a truly
sensational one. The entrance is a bit hidden, despite the Covent Garden
location, but once you’re inside you see it’s a real beauty of a basement
bar and dining room, which looks as if it’s been there for at least a
century – in fact, it only opened as a restaurant at the end of 2010. The
meat is of better quality, and better cooked, than at many more expensive
Mayfair steak restaurants. That’s not to say that Hawksmoor is cheap, of
course, but dining here is an experience that every omnivore should have at
least once.",

",
"When to go: When you want something smart and off-piste in Peckham.

What to have:Anything that’s been cooked in a pot or licked by the flames – try the lamb
braai: it’s seriously lekker.

A good-looking restaurant specialising in South African-inspired small
plates, Kudu may be named after a species of antelope, but don’t come here
expecting exotic decor: the dining room has the vibe of a sleek, vintage
lounge bar (all marble tables and crushed velvet banquettes), while the
kitchen shows its ‘rainbow nation’ allegiances with several dishes arriving
in traditional cast-iron skillets (as in the old country). Our picks? A pot
of warmly spiced mussels with seaweed-flecked gnocchi; a flawless tart of
caramelised onions and goat’s curd, and Kudu’s take on mosbolletjies (a
soft, sweet Afrikaans loaf that’s dunked into melted shrimp butter). With
enthusiastic switched-on staff doing the rounds, this is a real feather in
SE15’s cap.",
"When to go: When you’re craving some fabulously fresh Japanese finger food.

What to have: No contest. It has to be the temaki rolls, fresh from the chef’s fair hand
with the nori wrapping still crisp.

As Japanese restaurants go, Jugemu is rather humble and relaxed – the kind
of place where you have to pencil in your order on a basic paper menu. No
matter, the food here is a class apart, from the sushi and sashimi to warm
street-food snacks and cold plates such as bonito-flecked tomatoes in a
soupy wasabi/soy dressing. Ultimately, however, we would sell our souls for
just one of their incomparable temaki hand rolls – even though these are
only available at the counter.",
"When to go:When you want to get your glad-rags on and enjoy a decent meal in a smart
but relaxed central spot.

What to have:Go for small plates so you can try more, and don’t miss the radish,
celeriac, pomegranate and pecorino salad with truffle dressing – it’s a
Bocca classic.

There’s as much buzz around the food at this enduringly popular Soho
Italian as there is around the celebs who dine here. This can make getting
a table at short notice tricky for mere mortals, so book ahead. For the
full experience, counter seats make for a lively meal with views of the
chefs at work – but bear in mind it can get a bit hot there. Otherwise the
smart dining room at the back is more discreet. Take a tour of the regions
of Italy via small plates or large-portion dishes, with addictive
deep-fried snacks – such as breaded olives stuffed with minced pork and
veal – alongside salads, homemade pastas and grills.",
"What to have: The menu is deceptively large, but everything is delicious: if you’re
stuck, just pick an item from each section. The Josper-grilled seafood and
red meat cuts are particularly strong, but don’t miss the n’duja croquettes
if they’re on.    If you like Twist, you may like…Barrafina, The Counter at Sabor, Ember YardHere is a restaurant that’s about a thousand times cooler than its
oh-so-slightly naff name might suggest. The vibe is rustic chic and
atmospheric: all copper-pipe wine racks, unpainted plaster walls and worn
wooden floors. Factor in the warm, low lighting, and it’s a pretty perfect
spot for a date. Just make sure it’s someone deserving of the food, which
is, as you’ve probably figured, tapas with a ‘twist’. That is, creative and
contemporary, but not weird. Think Sicilian prawns served like a sashimi
salad, or Josperised (aka ‘torched’) hispi cabbage sprayed with chilli and
garlic oil at the table. Service on our visit was on the frosty side, but
we’re hoping that was a one-off. Besides, the food and atmos cancel it out.




",
"When to go: You need to commit and plan ahead, but the rewards are immense.

What to have: Seven plates. No choice. Always interesting. Perhaps venison Wellington
with a pear concealed inside it – or fermented cabbage and mint (from the
separate veggie menu).

Three pals. One teeny Hackney restaurant. A seven-course no-choice menu
(eight if you count bread, which you should, because it’s delicious), all
created from a single meat. Result? Something special. Nest’s focus is on
using on one animal at a time (the meat changes every six weeks or so).
There’s less waste. It’s more sustainable. Oh, and did we mention the
cooking is terrific, too? They get plus points for the atmospheric Paris
bistro via Hackney vibe and the enthusiasm of the small team. Nest is
simply charming.",
"When to go:When you want the sophistication and smoothness of a central London
restaurant, but with the friendliness and heart of a true local.

What to have:This is a fish-forward restaurant, but the juicy, crisp-skinned guinea fowl
with its daintily prepared, heartily flavoured Caesar-style salad is not to
be missed.

This former prison launderette (and sibling to the much-loved Primeur) has
been repurposed as a cool neighbourhood destination, serving the day’s best
produce in a constantly changing line-up of modern European dishes (all
delicious). The restaurant is decidedly of its time. Open kitchen? Check.
Communal tables? Of course. Almost illegible blackboard menu? Sure thing.
Natural wines? Oh yes. But instead of feeling like a cynical restaurant by
numbers, the concept fits this place as snugly as a just-washed pair of
jeans.",
"What to have: a plate of the perfect pasta (especially if you’re on a budget).
Otherwise, anything they suggest. It’s all simple, but sensational stuff.

"When to go:When you’re looking your best: everyone eating here has the glossily
groomed aura of a true Chelsea-ite.

What to have:The snacky starters are one of the highlights here – don’t miss the savoury
tapioca ‘marshmallow’. Desserts, conversely, aren’t worth much attention.

London gasped a collective ‘WTF?’ when Peruvian food was tipped as an
imminent mega-trend all those years ago, but look at us now – we can’t get
enough of the pisco sours and purple potatoes, the ceviches and seamlessly
integrated superfoods. Marylebone’s party-party Pachamama is a bigwig on
the Peruvian scene; this is its ever-so-slightly toned down sibling, which
sits pretty in deepest Chelsea. The open kitchen’s modish plates are as
small as a size zero dress but pack some impressive flavours – scoff them
with abandon and then forgo the more lacklustre desserts.",
"When to go:When you want some of that Bao magic, with a side order of razzle-dazzle
and minus the stomach-tightening queue (Xu takes bookings).

What to have:The pancakes with bone-marrow-enriched beef shortrib topped with potato
crumb – an insanely good mash-up of Peking duck pancakes and cottage pie.

The first thing anyone ever says about Xu is that ‘it’s from the people
behind Bao’. But Xu is an entirely different kettle of smoked eel. True,
it’s Taiwanese, but it’s a smart restaurant with a glam, vintage Taipei
vibe. Think waiters in black tie and upbeat jazz over the speakers, plus a
dedicated ‘tea bar’ and semi-private mahjong tables. The food is
sensational (don’t miss the chilli egg-drop crab) and the bill, given the
quality, will be affordable. Best of all, you can actually book.",
"When to go:When you don’t mind spending top-whack for tiny portions of food, so long
as they’re sensational (they are).

What to have:The double-crab roll with yuzu: the combination of Cornish spider crab and
soft shell crab makes this dish leg-tastic.

This long-awaited follow-up to the Marylebone original is Dinings 2.0. The
setting is fancier, for a start, and more spacious, with high ceilings,
arched windows and a marble counter for watching the chefs while you eat.
The menu, too, pushes the envelope, with shiny new dishes that are
‘ta-dah!’ stylish without teetering into show-off territory. Portions are
predictably tiny despite their high prices, but at least that gives you an
excuse to sample as much as your wallet will allow. You only live once,
peeps.",
"When to go: A dandy mash-up when food and wine are both on your mind.

What to have: There’s hardly a dud, but our fave is a dish simply described as ‘mussels
and tomatoes on toast’ – trust us, it’s magnificent!

Ellory is dead, long live Leroy. It’s the same team, and (almost) the same
name as before, but this EC2 reboot of the short-lived Hackney star is
miles better than the original – mainly because the whole package is much
more relaxed. The new site was originally a wine bar and the ethos of
pairing Euro-accented small plates with lovely glasses of vino lives on:
how about confit duck with plum and cobnuts complemented by a Grenache 2016
Le Grappin Côtes du Rhône? Ingredients are unfussy and the flavours shine –
from nuggets of tender, piquant quail on a skewer to locally cured trout
with a kaleidoscope of condiments, including a tiny Jenga stack of sweet
pickled cucumber. Hugely welcoming staff know their food – and their wine
too.",
"When to go:When you’re in the mood for well-constructed small plates in an
unpretentiously convivial atmosphere.

What to have:Mix and match from the concise, regularly changing menu – every dish is
primed to delight.

It’s not big, it’s not showy, but it is clever. This spot in Soho is the
kind of place you’ll want to come back to time and again. There’s only a
handful of dishes on the seasonally changing menu – stone bass with
artichoke, samphire and chorizo, courgette flowers with goat’s curd,
fregola and chestnut honey – but you’ll still have trouble choosing. Be
prepared to get friendly with your neighbours as the tables are tightly
packed, and be aware that it’s no-bookings for dinner, but that’s all part
of the charm.",
"When to go:Whenever you can get a table (book ahead or go off-peak if it’s a special
occasion, otherwise just try walking in for counter seats).

What to have:All the small plates: from burrata, to asparagus, to chicken liver parfait
and candied pecan. Of the larger dishes try the lamb, with its
deliciously pink middle, and serving of wild garlic and onions.

As with the eighteenth-century courtesan it’s named after, you pay Kitty
Fisher’s a visit if you want to leave with a smile but don’t mind paying
for the pleasure. Prices are high (this is Mayfair, after all), but really
luscious smaller dishes like smoked eel and parsely risotto make things
easier on the wallet. The basement dining room is intimate and atmospheric;
the street-level wine bar best on a sunny day (as are the two alfresco
tables overlooking so-picturesque-it-should-be-in-a-Richard-Curtis-movie
Shepherd Market). Putting your meal together from small plates is the best
way to leave without having spent a fortune.",
"When to go:When you have sartorially savvy peeps in tow, this is a super-chic place to
take them.

What to have:Skip snacks and mains – they’re perfectly lovely, but it’s the
small-plates-slash-starters and deconstructed puds that truly dazzle.

Frenchie is a very special sort of restaurant; a central London dining room
(right in the heart of Theatreland), elegant enough to take a top client,
yet relaxed enough to never make you feel uncomfortable or intimidated.
Part of the reason this balance has been so effortlessly achieved is thanks
to the ‘Frenchie’ himself, Gregory Marchand (the nickname was given to him
by Jamie Oliver, many years ago), who combines his classical, technical
training with a playful, creative approach to cooking. It’s why the
original Frenchie, in Paris, has a six-month waiting list. As for the
setting – if it’s light and airy you’re after, sit upstairs, at street
level; for more buzz (or on a gloomy day), go for the basement, where you
can watch the chefs glide around the gleaming open kitchen.",
"When to go:When you want to be surprised and delighted by a zeitgeist chef in a
zeitgeist restaurant.

What to have:Whatever you’re given (if you’re there at night) – there’s no choosing.

If you’re a picky customer, then visit this excellent Shoreditch eatery at
lunch: you’ll be able to choose what you like, and in what order. Come in
the evening, however, and you’ll get a no-choice four-course set menu of
acutely seasonal dishes that might include asparagus with cured pork fat
and walnuts in spring, or monkfish liver with peach and potato in summer,
followed by blackcurrant leaf meringue. The name of chef James Lowe’s
starkly minimal, achingly trendy Shoreditch restaurant references his
mother’s maiden name; he is definitely a young chef to watch.",
"When to go:When you have three friends free on the same night as you – you’ll not only
be able to book, but also request one of the lovely cabina-style booths.

What to have:The whole deep-fried sea bass, a sensational combo of delicate flesh,
crunchy roasted rice-battered skin and fragrant north-eastern Thai herbs.
The palm sugar ice cream with unripe banana (really) is insanely good, too.

Having raised funds to turn its residency in an east London coffee roastery
into a permanent restaurant (it took just three days to raise £700,000,
having only asked for £550,000), Som Saa finally opened its doors in April
2016. At last, everyone who’d ever wanted to sample the fiery Thai street
food menu could do so in a stylish and exotic former garment factory
walking distance from Liverpool Street (or Aldgate) tube. And sample it you
should. Despite the cooking being from two non-Thais (ex-‘MasterChef’
winner Andy Oliver is a Brit, Mark Dobbie is an Aussie), the authenticity
of spicing of some dishes is as
straight-from-the-hills-of-northern-Thailand as they come. If your palate
is naturally timid, go anyway, just ask the friendly staff to guide you.",

"When to go:When your palate needs a shake-up – one fuelled by the face-sweating heat
of full-throttle chilli peppers and fusion flavours from across West Africa.

What to have:Go back to basics with the jollof rice (topped with a wibbly-wobbly scoop
of smoked bone marrow), adding other modern takes on traditional West
African dishes at will. Even the okra is good.

Sometimes, a restaurant shakes you out of your small-plates stupor and
makes you realise how samey your dining experiences have become. Aside from
Morocco and its neighbours, African food is woefully underrepresented in
the capital; Ikoyi addresses this gap in the market, but without getting
all kitsch on our asses. Prepare for slices of buttermilk-fried plantain
that are sweet, smoky and swelteringly hot all at once, pink-hued mutton
chops with tamarind-spiced relish, and unbelievably tender chicken in
satay-style sesame-seed sauce. Ikoyi? A thrilling one-off (for now…).",
"When to go: When you’re after classic seafood in a cute Covent Garden setting.

What to have: the fabulously fresh daily specials.

You know the people behind 10 Cases? That cute Covent Garden wine bar? This
is from them. Great wine (obvs) but cracking seafood too. It’s a dinky
space, like a cross between a fishmonger and a wine bar (white tiles,
finned things on ice, central service bar, a mix of tables high and low).
Go for fresh-off-the-day boat grills or a mix of small plates and snacks,
like kick-ass cod roe and the fantastic sea trout tartare.",
"When to go:It’s a popular spot for media schmoozing, but also suited to a special
occasion when you don’t mind parting with a fair few pennies.

What to have:The robata-grilled scallops with wasabi cream made it into our 100 Best
Dishes in London.

Zuma’s little sister has no trouble standing up for itself. The
glass-fronted façade gives passersby a peek of the chefs at work preparing
robata-grilled goodies. Their lamb cutlets with Korean spices rank among
the best grilled dishes in London. As well as all things charcoal-cooked,
their raw dishes are also worth exploring, like ruby-red tuna sashimi. If
you’re in need of a stiff drink, head down to theShochu Loungein the basement.",

something is just a shared love of barbecued meat.

What to have: Haven’t yet tried Smokestak’s signature beef brisket? Prepare yourself for
moist, smoky meat heaped into a bun and topped with barbecue sauce,
bone-marrow butter and pickled chillies.

Like an A-lister heading towards a public meltdown, this former star of the
street food scene loves to smoke and doesn’t give a damn about
calorie-counting. That is a very good thing for us food lovers: expect some
big, big flavours on your plate, from garlicky mushrooms cooked in bone
marrow and served on beef dripping toast, through house-smoked pastrami
with pickled cabbage, to sticky toffee pudding with smoke-tinged ice cream.
Go hungry – and we mean, ‘haven’t-eaten-for-a-week’ hungry (channel those
A-listers…).",
"When to go:When you want your dinner to have style as well as substance – this place
is someone’s Pinterest board in restaurant form.

What to have:Stand-out veggie dishes include melt-in-the-mouth sweet-miso aubergine, and
crunchy broccoli tempura wrapped in black rice and nori.

The Japanese are masters of minimalism, and this gorgeous restaurant does
the aesthetic of its homeland justice with its serene décor, while
squeezing in a few design tropes pinched from the internet (see the
homespun specials ‘board’ for more details). The menu, too, is minimalist,
with just four cold and three hot main dishes, plus a couple of starters
and desserts. Thankfully, the lack of choice is a case of quality over
quantity: each mouthful, from thickly sliced, melt-in-the-mouth tuna
sashimi to piping-hot, chilli-licked karaage, and succulent charred pork
skewers, is deliciously satisfying – and pretty presentation feeds the eyes
as well as the stomach.",
"When to go: For lunch (Tuesday to Saturday) or a weekday dinner (Tuesday to Thursday),
both of which offer less weepingly expensive ways to eat here.

What to have: Whatever you’re given. It’s a tasting menu (and set lunch) kind of place.
But don’t panic: the food is beautiful, so you’re in safe hands.

If nothing else, the Roganic crew deserve an award for making this
once-awkward site on Marylebone’s Blandford Street, formerly home to
L’autre Pied, into a place of cool, calm loveliness. On the whole, the food
– from star chef Simon Rogan – is stunning. This is a tasting-menu-only
kind of a place (with long or short options, plus a much speedier set
business lunch that’s also a steal). And we especially like the service:
the GM is a delight.",
"When to go: When you’ve out in a group and you want a step up from tapas.

What to have: Small plates, snacks and sides. But save space for the lamb cutlets, too.


Forget everything we ever said about the first Santo Remedio. The
born-again-version of the Mexican restaurant, now moved from Shoreditch to
south of the river (opposite the Unicorn Theatre on Borough’s Tooley St),
is an absolute slam-dunk. A homely, gorgeous-to-look-at space, with
wonderful staff and terrific cooking, it’s arguably the best Mexican in
London. Do not miss the quesadilla or the guacamole. Grasshoppers optional!",
"What to have: The potato and roe (Smyth is from Northern Ireland: this is her homage).
It’s literally a large-ish waxy potato in a puddle of velvety beurre blanc,
with lip-smackingly briny trout roe and handmade, fermented-then-fried
crisps.

they’re paying: prices are at Tokyo levels, too.

What to have:The sashimi moriwase: 18 pieces of fish dressed up with edible flowers,
intricate vegetable carvings and fresh wasabi.

If you’re a stickler for authenticity when it comes to dining Japanese,
then Sakagura will be right up your street (actually, unless you own a
Mayfair pad, you’ll be tubing it there like the rest of us). But here,
authenticity and tradition aren’t bywords for a staid and strait-jacketed
experience: friendly, unpatronising staff are schooled in the good,
old-fashioned art of Japanese hospitality. The menu, like the decor,
seamlessly blends the modern with the traditional to fresh effect: the
sprout tempura, and the burdock and carrot sushi maki are delicious veggie
options.  ",
"When to go:Breakfast at The Wolseley is arguably the best meal of the day.

What to have:Owner Chris Corbin always orders the pancakes. If they’re good enough for
him…

This glamorous European grand café is a London institution that caters to
everyone without snobbery. Perhaps this is why not everyone can get a
booking, because of the sheer demand. So a date in the lofty, clattering
dining room – with its black marble pillars, geometric tiled floor and
imposing chandeliers – is a treat indeed. The eclectic all-day menu takes
luxury as its unifying theme: breakfasts of pastries, French toast and eggs
benedict segue into fruits de mer, caviar-laced omelettes and cream teas
later on in the day – all brought to the table by an army of expertly
trained staff.",

anchovies and mustard, to the silky, umami-rich calves’ brain meunière. Go
on…

Restaurateurs Will Lander and Daniel Morgenthau have cornered the market
for chic, contemporary small-plates outfits in Fitzrovia via Clipstone and
its sibling Portland. There’s a lot to like here: the understated, simple
dining room lets the food shine, and laid-back service fits with the
neighbourhood vibe that prevails despite the central London setting.
Snackettes such as steeply priced pork, rabbit and foie gras rillettes are
ruinously moreish; each of the main courses will contain at least one
ingredient you’ll have to ask about; but you’ll leave feeling you got your
money’s worth. ",
"When to go:When you’ve had the foresight to book weeks ahead for a fabulously fancy
fish supper.

What to have:The filleted fish dishes from the main menu are a particular delight.

Some of its younger A-list clients may have migrated toChiltern Firehouse, and it’s hard not to think about that Charles and Nigella incident, but
one thing’s for sure about Scott’s: it’s still one of the finest fish
restaurants in this fair town. The setting oozes glamour, from the grand
oyster bar (a great place to perch and survey the room), to the impeccably
groomed clientele and suave staff. Caviar, lobster and Dover sole may be
pitched at the money-to-burn crowd, but there are also humble sardines and
deep-fried haddock (complete with mushy peas), plus pretty much every
variety of seafood in between.",
"When to go:When nothing less than the best of the best will do.

What to have:The tasting menu if you’ve won the lottery, the set lunch if you haven’t.

Though recognised internationally as serving some of the best food (and
wine) in the world, The Ledbury retains the feeling of being a
neighbourhood restaurant. Yes, it is luxuriously kitted out and very
expensive. But it still has the laid-back atmosphere of the bistro round
the corner where they greet you by name. A key word for people who might
only eat here once is consistency. We have yet to hear anyone say, ‘I must
have been there on an off-night.’ The cooking of Australian-born Brett
Graham aims to turn unsurpassable raw ingredients into dishes that taste
unforgettably good; and flawless execution by a well-drilled brigade
ensures that it happens, apparently, every single time. Plan several months
in advance to bag a table in a prime dining slot, even for lunch. The wine
list is world-class and not scarily expensive considering the greatness of
the restaurant.",

boozy affair.

sticky date pudding to elderflower jelly.

Fondly remember sneaking a fag round the back of the school bike sheds?
Salubrious Rochelle Canteen has given the old bike sheds of the
neighbouring former Victorian school a new raison d’être. The blonde wood
tables of the airy dining room are populated by designer, media and arty
types all tucking heartily into the seasonal, ingredients-led menu – on
hot, sunny days, it’s a first-come, first-served dash to the courtyard
garden’s alfresco tables. Whatever the weather, expect simple, characterful
dishes – from rabbit terrine orSt John-style anchovy toast, to roast quail with aioli, fennel and lentils, and
blood-orange mess. Never mind the cigarettes – time to break out the
after-dinner cigars. Elsewhere, obvs.",
"When to go: When you’re in the mood for spice with a side order of

What to have: The vegetarian dishes are show-stealers (who gave broccoli a licence to
taste so good?) Also: do not leave without ordering the molten spice
chocolate cake with masala chai custard.

Ex-Tamarind chef Nirmal Save has pulled off a real humdinger of a
restaurant here: a hip, no reservations, East End Indian that puts the
identikit curry canteens of nearby Brick Lane to complete shame by focusing
on styled-up home cooking from all over the subcontinent. Cliché-busting
pan-Indian dishes all come with a story: the supremely tender,
cardamom-scented wild rabbit pulao is filched from an aunt; delicious
Kashmiri lamp chops are based on a recipe by Save’s mother-in-law; while
the dreamy spiced chocolate fondant with masala chai custard is based on
the chocolate chai sold on the streets of Mumbai. Gunpowder: you’ll have a
blast.",

slice of 1930s’ Shanghai whose lounge-style tables are angled towards the
live music acts on stage, it’s perfect for the sort of date where

A permanently buzzing hidey-hole for London’s social animals, this grand
dame of the Soho scene puts its serious face on during the day. That’s when
media types hold meetings and those old enough to know better soothe their
hangovers with brunch. And then it plays hard with the best of the rest
come clocking-off time. The long bar and polished loucheness of the
Georgian-era dining room are great for cocktails and people-watching, while
the menu of comfort food – think rib-eye with chips and béarnaise, or Dover

and so well known among tourists, that you’d be forgiven for assuming it
couldn’t possibly still be maintaining its original high standards. Wrong.
AtJ Sheekeyand its neighbouring oyster bar, the kitchen buys the cream of the marine
crop and serves it in (mostly) simple styles that do justice to this
top-flight produce. The menu in this lovely, capacious bar differs

‘forbidden’ rice bowl and the roast cauliflower steak are both memorable in
a good way.

The Ned is one of those London arrivals that you just have to visit, if
only to gawk at the staggeringly beautiful, no-expense-spared design job
that has transformed the ground floor of the hotel – a former banking hall
– into nine separate restaurants. This light-filled offering serves up a
flavour-packed, Cali-style clean-eating menu, with dishes that are mostly
suitable for veggies and vegans; the rest is a blend of on-trend imports
(hello, poke) and cleaned-up classics such as a gourmet burger in a potato
bun.",
"When to go:When you’re planning to splash the cash on a love interest – these heights
are romantic.

What to have:The deboned and deep-fried lamb ribs are tender and packed with flavour.

Halfway up The Shard, this glitzy Hong Kong import offers high-end Chinese
food with some of the best views of London. The smoulderingly stylish
interior, with plenty of dark wood and red lanterns, makes Hutong a
sophisticated dining spot for anyone aiming to impress their guests. Dishes
are no less showy with the likes of deep-fried soft-shell crabs arriving in
a huge bowl of fiery red chillies – the latter purely for decoration.
Southwestern and Northern Chinese dishes less commonly seen on London menus
are the main attraction, but there are also more familiar dishes such as
crispy duck, plus steamed dumplings to choose from on the lunchtime dim sum
list.",
"When to go:When you fancy a French experience of ‘Amélie’-esque proportions.

What to have:A golden oldie such as chicken chasseur.

Ask anyone to list 20 things they’d expect to see in a classic French
bistro and chances are you’ll find at least 15 of them at this dinky Gallic
charmer, including lettered mirrors, tobacco-coloured walls and a tubby
Michelin figurine behind the bar. The restaurant has been full from day one
because of its sensible prices, artful grub, elbow-to-elbow bonhomie and
peerlessly efficient staff. The chalkboard menu majors in boldly flavoured
French hits such as fish soup, steak tartare and boeuf bourguignon, plus
plenty of wines by the carafe.",
"When to go:When you’re in the mood for a bit of glamour.

What to have:One of the classics-with-a-twist starters, such as prawn cocktail with
lobster jelly, avocado and crispy shallot. Or a slice of uber-traditional
pork pie with piccalilli, hewn tableside.

Jason Atherton’s third opening of 2013 took a different turn from his
highly successful Social ventures (Pollen Street Social,Little Social,Social Eating House,City SocialandSocial Wine & Tapas) with an impressively showy setting. From opulent chandeliers to
floor-to-ceiling framed art, enjoy Atherton’s signature modern European
dishes in the grandest of settings. Your credit card is sure to get a
battering – this kind of decadent dining doesn’t come cheap. But for a
special occasion it’s the ideal place to get your glad-rags on and eat in
style. Be sure to enjoy a cocktail in thePunch Room(booking advisable) before heading into the glitzy dining room (or do away
with an Ageing Hipster – a typically inventive riff on an Old Fashioned –
from the comfort of your table).",
"When to go: Special occasions when you feel like flashing your cash on some seriously
modern food.

What to have: Something raw, something cooked and something sweet.

A long way from St Leonards by the seaside, this spacious Shoreditch eatery
is cool but classy, with a look that says casual, cutting-edge elegance.
The kitchen is open, but mostly hidden, allowing the two opposing prep
stations (an icy raw bar and a smouldering wood-fired oven) to take
centre-stage. It’s not especially radical, but the food is quietly
self-assured, with dabs of creativity applied to its modern European
plates. An unexpectedly pretty assemblage of wild sea bass crudo draped in
wisps of lardo and slices of sweet kohlrabi, for example, or nicely charred
bavette under a snowdrift of micro-planed bone marrow. Or even a
deconstructed twist on rum baba involving black treacle, bonfire-smoky
pineapple and anise-scented ice cream. Keep an eye on the bill, though,
unless you’re bookmarking this one for a no-holds-barred bash.    ",
"When to go:When David Beckham asks you out for dinner. It’s the easiest way to get a
table.

What to have:The kitchen can do fiddly and pretty, exemplified by stunning appetisers
such as the tiny, slider-like ‘doughnuts’ filled with crab meat. We love
love love the steak tartare so much that it’s one of our Top 100 dishes.

If you think you’re just going to pick up the phone and book for dinner
tomorrow, dream on. Chiltern Firehouse was a restaurant sensation when it
opened in 2014, featuring in tabloids weekly as yet another huddle of
celebrities was papped leaving the premises. Yet despite the media
frenzy, it is an excellent restaurant – in fact, the warm service and
unusual modern international combinations from chef Nuno Mendes make it
even more memorable than the clientele. Sit by the kitchen counter if you
can, where you can watch the dishes being assembled: it’s like watching the
Bolshoi Ballet limbering up.",
"When to go:When your Instagram and Twitter accounts need some attention.

What to have:It’s Hobson’s choice – although vegetarians get their own menu.

A self-consciously hip affair, with a no-choice tasting menu of on-trend
ingredients in out-there combinations, The Clove Club unashamedly puts food
at the centre of its experience. The stark, Shaker-style dining room with
its attractively utilitarian furniture and most open of kitchens feels part
pop-up, part school dinner hall, but the food is a major departure from
both – seasonal, esoteric ingredients fill the ever-changing menu. The cosy
bar is worth a try, too, with excellent bar snacks that make a lighter (and
cheaper) alternative to a full meal – try the buttermilk-fried chicken with
pine salt – a throwback from chef Isaac McHale’s days at white-hot residencyUpstairs at the Ten Bells.",
"When to go:When you have menu fatigue or need an in-and-out treat.

What to have:The burger is undeniably tasty, but the lobster wins in the value stakes.

Burger & Lobster wins fans for its simple, high quality and great value
offerings of prime burgers, lobsters or lobster rolls, with salad and
chips. The bijouMayfair originalwas promptly packed out, and its resolutely first come, first served policy
saw huge queues forming. So this Soho behemoth was swiftly opened to soak
up the lobster-loving overflow. It boasts a huge, lively dining room and
lightning-quick service, meaning it easily accommodates bookings and
walk-ins alike. Still, queues at peak times are inevitable for spontaneous
types. The latest one is in West India Quay.",
"When to go:When you want to surprise someone with south-of-the-river sophistication.

What to have:The homemade pasta is a knockout – but leave room for the day’s cake (lemon
polenta with crème fraîche, perhaps).

This classy venture in Peckham thumbs its nose at run-of-the-mill local
Italians. With its smart looks, daily menu of simple yet accomplished
dishes and carefully chosen cellar, it could give the best central London
Med joints a run for their money. The minimal interior, complete with
communal table and open kitchen in the back room, lets the food do the
talking. The short menu – full of punchy propositions such as smoked ox
heart with romesco sauce plus own-made pasta and wickedly good ice cream –
is an ambitious labour of love that further ups the ante on Peckham’s
poshest street.",
"When to go:Early: at peak times your wait for a table can top two hours (although two
hours spent in a bar with your mates is never time wasted…).

What to have:The quesadilla: less dude food, more el dude food, it’s an open-faced slice
of tortilla topped with a mess of meat, melted cheese, coriander and salsa.

Just when we thought the Hart brothers (the charmers behind Barrafina and
Quo Vadis) couldn’t put a foot wrong… Gotcha! Of course their boho taco
joint in Borough Market has been a Beatles-level hit. Sam Hart and a music
mogul friend/co-owner once ran a club in Mexico City, so the vibe here is
party party party, and the menu matches that Latin spirit: the signature
taco comes topped with 24-hour marinated pork and cubes of pineapple, the
salsas are slap-yourself fresh and there’s a serious mezcal menu to
complement the frozen margaritas.",
"When to go: When you’re in the mood for seafood in a quirky setting.

What to have: Dinky battered fish and triple cooked chips. But also the veg,
particularly anything beginning with ‘Textures of…’. And any kind of panna
cotta. Trust us.

Broadway Market just gets better and better. Not only does it have the
brilliant Plot, but now there’s this seafood specialist on the same
corridor, in the corner spot. As for the food – the seafood small plates
are excellent, but there’s more to it than that, including beautiful veg
dishes, the odd meat option (also good) and killer puds. Fun fact: that
nice man looking after you is probably co-owner Jimmy Luttman, a one-time
fireplace fitter who started up Sea Garden with his chef buddy Stacey
Clifton. They’ve been pals since nursery. Aww.  ",
"When to go:When your lunchtime destination needs to feel like a home away from home.

What to have:Plenty of small plates to pick at, plus something sweet – their cakes are
too good to pass up.

If you’re in Fitzrovia, for any reason at all, make a beeline for this
little Israeli-run café. The menu is full of homely Middle Eastern dishes
alive with colour and texture – think peach and goats’ cheese salad with
roasted almonds and orange-blossom dressing, or spiced lamb siniya baked in
tahini, wrapped in a pitta and topped with yoghurt and salad. The
husband-and-wife team who run the place have impressive credentials as the
ex-head-chef atOttolenghiand executive chef atNopi. Their idea here is to create dishes inspired by the food they grew up
with, everything from what their mums made to the street food of Jerusalem.
It’s all made fresh on the premises, and the window is filled with breads,
pastries and exotic jams.",
"When to go:When you’re dining à deux, haven’t booked, and want to get really up close
and personal at the counter with your date.

What to have:Everything off the ‘raw’ (more accurately: ‘cold’) bar is terrific, such as
the beautiful beetroot carpaccio with burnt goat’s cheese, hazelnut brittle
and a drizzle of pomegranate molasses vinaigrette.

Ever since YotamOttolenghifirst introduced Londoners to the notion of ‘Jerusalem’ food (modern,
non-kosher Israeli cooking) we haven’t been able to get enough of it. Just
look at The Palomar. In its opening week it was full of homesick Israelis
tucking into dishes influenced by the Levant, North Africa and southern
Spain. Within weeks, though, they’d been elbowed out by native Soho-ites,
squeezing onto the cramped no-bookings counter seats (warning: you’re
likely to get seriously jostled) or booking weeks in advance for the small
back room (less lively, but more comfortable). The downside: tables are now
turned every two hours, and service can occasionally feel muddled.",
"When to go:When you want a beautiful meal but without that ‘oof’ feeling at the end.

What to have:Norwegian king crab or quail with bacon popcorn – just two of their
classics.

Long before the so-called New Nordic fashion infiltrated London’s menus,
this dining room in a former Georgian townhouse was turning out food that
was quietly groundbreaking. Though of the haute school in creativity and
technical detail, the dishes – courtesy of Icelandic head chef and
co-founder Agnar Sverrisson – were (and are) deliciously light, with butter
and cream both banned. Staff are charming and polished without being afraid
to let their personalities shine through. A delightful place.",
"When to go:When you want inventive cooking with no affectations.

What to have:The menu changes weekly, and you don’t get a choice, but it’s always
interesting – from sea trout with delicate elderflower-infused beurre
blanc, tart gooseberries, yellow beetroot and chickweed, to desserts based
on a Thai-style Pimm’s.

Love supper clubs but can’t be bothered with the restrictive dates and
dodgy venues? Then you’ll like Pidgin, one of a growing breed of polished
eateries with supper-club souls. The debut restaurant from James Ramsden
and Sam Herlihy, one-time hosts of acclaimed supper club The Secret Larder,
it’s a super-cute, wonderfully convivial neighbourhood spot with
copper-trimmed tables, twigs they’ve gathered from the New Forest on the
walls and a seascape-papered loo complete with the sound of crashing
thunder overhead. The food, which costs £40 for four courses (and includes
bread with ‘burnt’ butter, gooey chocolate truffles and a shot of
‘Pidgincello’ at the end), is terrific.",
"When to go:For a casual first date (or a double date if you want to book). Start
things off right with exotic cocktails in the stylish drinking den.

What to have:Where to start? Everything is yummy, but unmissable dishes are the
pomegranate-studded kid goat raan and the butter crab, packed with garlic
and chilli.

This Indian small-plates star has knocked Soho for six since it made the
move from Brixton shipping container to bricks and mortar. (There’s now a
permanent spot back in Brixton, too). The industrialised decor is familiar:
metal ducts and cage lighting dominate the dining room and open kitchen,
although softer touches include blush-pink upholstered stools at the shiny
L-shaped counter. The concise menu, however, is no such thing: it offers
the likes of bone-marrow kulcha flatbreads, samphire pakoras, and tandoori
monkfish with coconut chutney, all delivered in sizes perfect for sharing.
Over-order at will, with no regrets.",
"When to go:When you want to show a sceptic how far casual British dining has come.

What to have:The kitchen’s homage to the Viennetta combines dark chocolate, salted
caramel and own-made ice cream.

The three brothers behind this jolly venue have filled their rustic dining
room with tongue-in-cheek farm references such as reclaimed tractor parts,
bright portraits of cows and oil drums for tables. However, their
intentions are sincere: many ingredients, plus wines, are sourced from the
family’s West Sussex farm and vineyard. Start with inventive ‘mouthfuls’
such as hake rillettes, then choose from ‘fast cooking’ or ‘slow cooking’
selections, including the terrific pastry-wrapped beef ‘cigars’, served
with the house-made mustard. Each plate has a spring in its step, and
smiley staff encourage sharing – you’ll wish it was your local.",
"When to go:It’s the best place in London for alfresco dining.

What to have:Breakfast and brunch are just as appealing as the dinner menu.

Chef Anna Hansen used to work with Peter Gordon atThe Providores, and stylistically, her eclectic cooking style reflects this shared
heritage. A signature dish of sugar-cured New Caledonian prawn omelette
with spring onion, coriander and smoked chilli sambal is a winner, and we
love the ambition and invention in the likes of baharat-and hazelnut
oil-marinated duck breast, with root vegetable rosti, blood orange-glazed
carrots and hispi cabbage slaw, or ajowan-flavoured pannacotta with
lavender, poppyseed and milk crumb, drizzled with orange sauce. It’s
particularly appealing in the summer, when you can sit outdoors in serene
St John’s Square.",
"When to go:If your idea of a good meal out involves chair dancing in a disco-leaning
dining room while getting messy with peerless fried chicken.

What to have:The Korean-style fried chicken in a bun, topped with crunchy slaw,
gochujang mayo and chilli vinegar – paired with a house sour, obviously.

Badass chef Carl Clarke has followed up his string of celebrated pop-ups
with this good-times diner dedicated to gourmet fried chicken,
straight-shooting cocktails and fun. The buzzy dining room, with its dimmed
lights, tightly crammed tables and thudding music, is a no-brainer for
kicking off a night out in east London – as long as you don’t mind getting
your hands dirty. The chicken is marinated in buttermilk before being fried
in rapeseed oil; it’s then paired with wonderful, unexpected, Far East
flavours or potent dips – bone-marrow barbecue sauce, for instance, or
oh-no-they-didn’t blue-cheese and buttermilk dip. You’ll struggle not to
dance on the tables. But don’t.",
"When to go:When you’re after a street food fix in a contemporary restaurant setting.

What to have:Swerve familiar options such as Thai fishcakes in favour of inventive
curries and salads.

Back in 2012 when The Begging Bowl opened, the phrase ‘street food’ didn’t
carry the same cachet. The restaurant was brave and bold not only in
experimenting with Thai flavours and styles more often found on the
streets, but also in setting up shop in Peckham before the likes of Artusi
and Pedler had helped make this part of town the dining destination it is
now. But it’s no surprise it’s so ahead of the imitators with chef Jane
Alty, who trained under Thai expert David Thompson, at the helm. In Begging
Bowl’s bright and beautiful setting, Alty is continually reinventing her
repertoire – packing in plenty of research trips to Thailand. So get
Thai-ed up with seriously sticky pork belly, lemongrass-heavy
charcoal-grilled bream, cutting-edge red curries and nahm prik to blow your
head off.",
"When to go:When you’re with your very best mates and you want to eat, drink and get
the party started.

What to have:The cauliflower shawarma (order an extra plate – do it!) and the hummus.
For something more meaty, it has to be the smoked pork belly lavished with
pomegranate molasses babrecue sauce.

First things first: Berber & Q is not the place if you want a quiet
chitchat, or if you’re one of those chronic hand-washers who can’t touch
anything sticky. This stripped-back, under-the-arches Haggerston spot (near
neighbour toTonkotsu East) is loud and dark; food comes heaped on sharing trays, and eating with
fingers is encouraged. Flavours are Middle Eastern and smoky, but unlike
most grill joints, it’s the vegetarian dishes that really shine. The
deliciously charred cauliflower shawarma, with its balance of sweetness and
smoke, softness and crunch, is mind-blowingly good, but don’t overlook the
tahini-slathered, pine nut-strewn hummus either. Team it with a cocktail –
we love the Haggerstoned, a citrusy muddle of tequila, green Chartreuse,
pistachio syrup and orange bitters. TheirShawarma Bar, on Exmouth Market, is a fittingly epic kebab shop for London’s most
gastronomic street.",
"When to go:At night, to make the most of the Italian-inspired cocktails in the
hideaway bar before your meal.

What to have:The menu changes after each trip to the market, but everything is dreamy –
indeed, we’ve dreamed of returning just for the saffron arancini.

The Deptford foodie tide looks set to turn with the arrival of this sibling
to Artusi, the Italian that boosted Peckham’s irreversible rise to foodie
stardom. The deal here is more or less the same: an understatedly trendy
dining room where exquisite Italian dishes made with mostly homemade and
market-fresh ingredients are lovingly plated up for your delectation.",
"When to go:When you’re in the mood for Turkish with a side order of chic.

What to have:The lahmacun – a kind of Turkish flatbread pizza topped with minced lamb,
which comes with fresh salad (greens and pickled things) that you put in
the middle and roll up, to make the best wrap you’ll have this year.

Selin Kiazim is what you’d call a slow burner. She spent years atProvidores, and later,Kopapa, learning everything there was to know about smart fusion cooking. No-one
had heard of her. Then, at last, she quit, embarking on her dream: to open
a restaurant of her own before the age of 30. The first thing she did was
host a clutch of acclaimed residencies, testing out her
Turkish-with-a-twist cooking and building up a cult following along the
way: smart cookie. In November 2015, she finally launched Oklava – a
tasteful restaurant on the City fringes (more savvy suits than scruffy
Shoreditch) where she could finally showcase the likes of monkfish with
spiced runner beans or her trademark chilli garlic chicken with a za’atar
crumb (aka Turkish fried chicken). Bravo, Ms Kiazim – keep up the good work.",
"When to go:When you want food that’s prepared with cutting-edge direction but served
in a welcoming and unpretentious setting.

What to have:The astonishing-value set menu – five courses, including the signature
cuttlefish bolognese, for a bargainous £38.

Stoke Newington has always been strong on locals’ locals, but who knew it
could produce something like this destination diner? Perilla’s gently
Scandi interiors generate plenty of atmosphere, which is only added to by
the friendly, informed service from its down-to-earth team. Add to the mix
inventive Modern European dishes – from seaweed bread brushed with lamb fat
and topped with kale and avocado, to spanking fresh fish soup zhushed up
with blood orange – and you’ve got a neighbourhood restaurant worth
travelling to.",
"When to go:When you want all the perks of dining in central London, but without having
to actually travel there.

What to have:We loved everything, so you can’t go far wrong. But if the rabbit niçoise
salad is on the menu, order it.

Anyone living within walking distance of this all-day neighbourhood
restaurant in Herne Hill is one lucky duck – prepare to smugly namedrop
this place into all future restaurant-based conversations. It’s perfect:
the interiors are stylish yet unshowy; the drinks list includes extremely
well curated wines; and the service is impeccable. Best of all is the
hearty European food: from meltingly tender Hereford beef-shin ragu atop
creamy polenta to a sexed-up niçoise salad filled with confit rabbit meat,
and don’t-stop-me-now desserts. ",
"When to go:At lunchtime for the peace and quiet (and a lower spend); at dinner for the
buzz, the great wine list, and the cheering flavour of charcoal.

What to have:The pappardelle with beef shin ragù is so famous it had its own Twitter
account – and so popular it made the leap onto the menu at sister
restaurant Padella.

This two-floor contemporary Italian is still as frenetically popular with
Highbury gourmets as it was when it first opened in 2010 – pity anyone who
attempts to get a table here for dinner on spec (they’d have more luck at
lunchtime). Trullo is all about simple pleasures – its stripped-back
interiors are stylishly unfussy, while the kitchen team takes a
back-to-basics approach to the menu. Fresh homemade pasta, rolled just
before service, is a must-order – it’s too good to drown in gloopy sauce;
instead, its quality is allowed to shine through simple seasonal adornments
such as marjoram, golden garlic and parmesan. Elsewhere on the short menu,
top-quality cuts of meat and ozone-fresh fish are cooked simply over
charcoal and served with rustic sides. Desserts, too, are taken seriously –
and are seriously delicious, with tarts a speciality. The wine list boasts
an excellent selection of Italian regional wines, including natural and
biodynamic options.",
"When to go:When you want upscale Italian comfort food with the cool factor that those
Knightsbridge and Mayfair old-timers lack.

What to have:Start with a round of gossamer-light, superbly crisp parmesan fries for the
table (and one of Campari sodas).

For their follow-up to the highly acclaimed Clove Club, Isaac McHale and co
have, happily, not succumbed to Difficult Second Album Syndrome. Luca is a
looker – all understated glamour with the whisper of money swaying its
beautiful drapes – and its concept of ‘British ingredients through an
Italian lens’ is a clever continuation of the cooking that made its sibling
such a success, without the set menu format. This is fancy but approachable
food: bruschetta eschews tomatoes for cream-baked spider crab; pasta is
paired with pistachio pesto; and the tiramisu is a game-changing trifle.",
"



",
"When to go:When you want the real deal without flying to Tokyo.

What to have:This is the place to truly experienceomakase– that is, to leave everything in the chef’s (very capable) hands.

London may not be lacking high-end sushi restaurants, but Yashin in
particular bridges the gap between quality and creativity. As at some sushi
bars in Japan, soy sauce and wasabi are not offered for diners to use as
they please. Instead, the sushi chef crafts and seasons each piece
differently, to bring out certain qualities of every piece of fish or
shellfish. A fatty piece of salmon nigiri may be lightly blow-torched to
enhance its flavoursome oils, for example, then balanced by cubes of tangy,
citrus ponzu jelly.",
"When to go:On a mild night, when the fairy lights are turned on and you can appreciate
the outdoors-indoors setting with a cold, locally brewed beer – no coat
required.

What to have:In winter, oxtail croquettes are a winner; in summer, perhaps south coast
squid with heritage tomatoes and British chorizo. Just don’t stint on
dessert.

This smart, slick operation is one of a number of trendy restaurants
neighbouring the knock-off leather jackets and mobile phone accessories on
sale in Tooting Broadway Market. Even though competition here is stiff,
Plot is worth making a beeline for: its highly seasonal menu is short
enough to give you an excuse to try everything, its staff are winningly
charming, and as many ingredients as possible are proudly local. Desserts
are a strength, from buttery, sweet-salt Bakewell tart with blood-orange
marmalade, to lemon posset with Earl Grey-soaked prunes and peppercorn
shortbread.",
"When to go:Unless you live in Lewisham, you’re going to have to organise a pilgrimage
here – but it will be well worth your time on the Tube and train.

What to have:You’re spoilt for choice, with not a dud on this varied and inventive menu.
Try the malt duck with its papery, fatty skin, and the rustic yet
sophisticated green risotto.

Like a mirage shimmering at the side of the A20, Sparrow looks too good to
be true. But the restaurant is real, in all its white-walled,
aquamarine-tiled, pared-back glory. Step inside and into another world, one
in which the kitchen melds expertise honed in big-hitting restaurants, such
as Pollen Street Social, with a casual, makeshift vibe. Dishes are as
diverse as three styles of duck (malted breast, confit leg and crisp skin)
and satay rabbit, but all are thrilling – especially when discovered in
SE13.",
"When to go:When you’re in Soho, feeling spontaneous and with flush friends.

What to have:The house ajo blanco is a creamy, luxurious taste bomb.

This warm and inviting nook in the heart of Soho manages to be both
authentically Spanish and admirably cliché-free (apart from the giant hams
dangling from the ceiling). High communal tables, a clattering ambience and
rapid-fire service make it a perfect post-work pit-stop – as does the
exquisitely considered wine list, which offers nearly everything by the
glass and carafe. The menu, inspired by the day’s market, mixes top-notch
charcuterie with well-balanced dishes such as cauliflower gratin with
manchego and miga, or pork jowl with butterbeans and raisin dressing, all
at restrained prices – although, as with most tapas joints, the bill
swiftly gathers momentum.",
"When to go:During the day for the best open-face Danish sandwiches in London, at night
for exquisite Nordic restaurant dishes.

What to have:Open sarnies and pastries by day (try the divine ‘bread and butter pud’
made out of Danish pastries); whatever you’re given at night. Expect light,
high-precision cooking with a focus on cured, smoked and spankingly fresh
fish that will make you feel like 6,750,000 krone (approx. $1m).

Kell and Jacqueline Skött are a daring duo. Struggling to recruit stylists
for their second hair salon, they chanced upon a government initiative
allowing A3 retail spaces to be converted to A1 restaurants for two years
without planning. They had long dreamed of running a Danish café (she’s
British, he’s a Dane). So, they called their lawyer on the
Wednesday, agreed on the Thursday, told staff on the Friday and partied on
the Saturday. Initially daytime only, they later took on Tania Steytler, a
Cornish chef so exceptionally skilled, her £35 no-choice Friday night menu
is now available from Thursdays to Saturdays, thanks to local demand.",
"When to go:Best when you’re already in the area, but any time if you need a taste of
the true south (of Europe).

What to have:The specials of the day. Clams with garlic and parsley, perhaps, lamb leg
with flat beans and olives, or turbot with borlotti and bacon.

A former car garage in a residential part of Highbury, this lovely
restaurant is a slick operation hiding behind a practised nonchalant
exterior. The menu – scribbled on a piece of A4, hot off the kitchen press
– combines the rustic savoir-faire of France and the gastronomic gusto of
Italy with the best of British seasonal produce: daily-changing
Med-accented dishes range from salt veal with borlotti beans and vibrant
green sauce, to spider-crab soup with punchy aioli. The wine list is as
much of a draw as the food: from the hundred-bin cellar, staff pick a dozen
or so wines for the day’s list, mostly low-intervention, many by the glass.",
"When to go: When you’re out with your best pals and in the mood for pimped-up
backpacker fodder in a good-looking setting.

What to have: The grilled street eats, rolled into Vietnamese pancakes, are great for
sharing, as are the seafood pancakes, and the chicken and prawn dumplings.

West Londoners: rejoice. Mam is here to save you from yet another
gastropub. Exotic but stylish, the look is Saigon by way of Shoreditch (but
of course you’re in W11, not E1). It does all kinds of Vietnamese street
food, from huge (and I mean huge) rice bowls to snack plates to
barbecue-slash-taco platters (lovely grilled things for wrapping up in
lettuce or rice noodle pancakes). Friendly service, too. Big tick, W11, big
tick.",
"When to go:When you want a kick-ass modern Indian meal in retro Raj-era surrounds.

What to have:Kick off with one of the selection of posh tikkas – the tandoori broccoli,
perhaps, or the pricey but delicious stone bass tikka.

Gymkhana models its look on Indian colonial clubs in the days of the Raj.
But if the look and feel are retro, co-founder Karam Sethi’s cooking is
anything but. Based on regional cuisines from across the subcontinent, the
cooking is modern in approach, and the spice can be serious without
overwhelming the layers of big and subtle flavours that bring this menu to
life. There is even a nice touch of theatricality: Indian punches come in
sealed medicine bottles, with an ice-filled silvery goblet on the side.",
"When to go:When you’re after a Latin dance party on your palate.

What to have:The Don Ceviche (sea bass chunks in citrus with a scattering of red chilli
and soft, diced sweet potato) is the winner in the world of raw fish.

There was a flurry of Peruvian openings in London in 2012, but Ceviche –
which has since spawnedan Old Street offshoot– was the Machu Picchu, towering over several peaks. Showcasing the
eponymous dish of citrus-cured fish spiked with chilli, the place serves
half a dozen versions of ceviche. But the kitchen knows a lot more than
just how to skin and slice a fish – there are also excellent chargrilled
meat and fish skewers (anticuchos), crumbly corn cakes and other nibbles on
offer. Be sure to sample a pisco sour or two at the bar while you’re there.",
"When to go: With its high price tag, enduringly cool atmosphere and exquisite food,Hakkasanis strictly for the hottest of dates and the most special of occasions
(unless you’re the lucky owner of an expense account…)

What to have: Long-standing, budget-blowing signatures are up front and centre on the à
la carte and include a delectable version of Peking duck with caviar.

The original and best branch of this high-end Chinese restaurant spawned a
global empire – even almost 20 years on it’s easy to see why trendsters
from Miami to Mumbai crave a taste of it. Hakkasan’s magic lies in its heady combination of high-octane atmosphere (is that a
triple A-lister you spy through the gloom, or an anonymous local hottie?)
and wonderfully executed, luxury-laden dishes. If you can afford to go all
out, do so. If not, what the hell are you doing here?  ",
"When to go: When entertaining serious food lovers.

What to have: Something you’ve never heard of or wouldn’t normally try. It will be great.

As ‘British cuisine’ continues to establish its own identity, it becomes
clearer how groundbreaking Fergus Henderson’s Smithfield restaurant really
was. It’s far from faddy, and St John’s continued commitment to
well-sourced, simply cooked traditional food has stood the test of time:
it’s still one of the most reliably exciting places to eat in London, 21
years after opening its doors. Forgotten cuts and obscure ingredients grace
the twice-daily-changing menu, and despite the reputation for concentrating
on meaty things, fish cookery is expert and very serious. While this
stripped-down luxe doesn’t come cheap, neither is it as expensive as
roughly comparable places. St John remains a model other restaurants aspire
to.",
"When to go:It’s off the beaten track in Soho, so you can afford to be a little
spontaneous; but ring first anyway, and avoid peak times.

What to have:The meats and fish are all beautifully grilled, but make sure you try some
of the vegetable dishes, such as the courgette flowers stuffed with monte
enebro cheese and drizzled in blossom honey.

The Salt Yard Group have produced some stunning but little-known
restaurants such asDehesaandOpera Tavern, and have gone from strength to strength as they add new branches. Taking
the Italian-Iberian small-plates ethos ofSalt Yard, but with the cooking done over smoky coals, Ember Yard goes one better.
The ground floor is a wine bar and restaurant with lots of warm woods; if
you’re in the basement, try for the bar counter. Every tapas flavour
combination is a winner; tender octopus with peas, smoked tomato and wild
garlic, say, or Ibérico pork ribs grilled to melting softness.",
"When to go:When your private jet is having its MOT but you can’t shake your longing
for a sun-soaked taste of Provence.

What to have:The lamb à la ficelle is French peasant food at its finest – it’s cooked
dangling over a wood fire, then served with creamy white beans and salsa
verde.

This southern French stunner gets things just right without conforming to
the straitjacket of current restaurant trends. It’s run by a protégé of
Stevie Parle, and his influence is evident in everything from the
meticulous sourcing of top-quality ingredients to the back-to-basics
approach of the kitchen, which produces dishes whose insouciant appearance
belies a huge amount of behind-the-scenes preparation. Tuck into the likes
of roast quail slathered in piquant anchovy sauce, courgettes stuffed with
creamy, featherlight brandade, and melt-in-the-mouth ratatouille, washed
down with Viognier on tap.",
"When to go:When your gastronomic sat nav says no to a Brick Lane curry.

What to have:The house special, lamb raan, which is a slow-marinated, spice-laden
delight.

The second of four branches (the first inCovent Garden, the third inKing’s Cross, the latest inSoho), this Dishoom is one of the best places to eat in Shoreditch. The
interior is modelled on the Iranian cafés of Bombay, with booths and mosaic
floors creating intimate nooks with a charming makeshift feel – but also
with a touch of cool. Dishes on the feisty modern Indian menu are vividly
described and peppered with brilliant asides and interesting facts –
whether referring to superior versions of chicken tikka and lamb biryani,
or lesser-known classics such as a Frankie. Spicy breakfasts and brunches
throw a cracking curveball, too.",
"When to go:For a lunchtime dalliance with dumplings.

What to have:Look to the dim sum specials list for innovative treats (fried minced squid
balls, maybe), and don’t miss the black sesame dumplings in peanut crumbs
to finish.

After all these years, the original Royal China branch still holds its
position at the top table of London’s dim sum venues. Enter its glossy
black-lacquered interior, where curling waves and geese in full flight
embellish the walls, and deliberate over the menu of mouth-watering snacks.
Glutinous rice in lotus leaves (wonderfully aromatic, full of delicious
tidbits) will provide ballast for such delicacies as honey roast pork puffs
(divine pastry) and scallop dumplings, as well as inspired creations from
the specials list. The full menu has its attractions, too, including
classic stewed pork belly hotpot."]
